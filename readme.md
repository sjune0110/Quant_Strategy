# Election Market Project

Independent project by Seugjoon Oh(osjun11@gmail.com).

This work is inspired by the paper:
"Stock Market Volatility around National Elections" (Bialkowski, Gottschalk, Wisniewski, 2006; p22006.pdf),
which shows that election structure and outcomes can affect stock market volatility.

## What this repository does
- `electionnews`: Find candidate-related tickers based on mention frequency in news.
- `election_strategy`: Run portfolio and long-straddle strategies using those candidate-linked tickers.

## How to use
1. Read each folder's `README.md` for setup and key parameters.
2. Experiment by changing the major parameters described there.
3. The same flow can be applied to the 2028 U.S. presidential election.

## Roadmap
- Currently extending the framework to other countries' presidential and parliamentary elections.
